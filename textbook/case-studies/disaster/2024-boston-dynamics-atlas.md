# Case Study: Boston Dynamics Atlas

## Summary

Atlas represents the most advanced dynamic humanoid robot, evolving from DARPA Robotics Challenge origins to demonstrations of parkour, construction site work, and autonomous navigation. In 2024, Boston Dynamics transitioned to an all-electric Atlas platform.

## Key Technical Achievements

1. **Dynamic Locomotion**: Running, jumping, parkour
2. **Hydraulic to Electric**: 2024 platform redesign
3. **Whole-body Coordination**: Simultaneous locomotion and manipulation

## Applications

- Disaster response research
- Construction site demonstrations
- Research platform

## Related Modules

- **Module 08: Locomotion**
- **Module 10: Simulation to Real**
- **Module 13: Full-Body Autonomy**
