# Lab 10-03: Complete Sim-to-Real Transfer Pipeline

## Objectives

- [ ] Train controller in randomized simulation
- [ ] Deploy trained policy to real TurtleBot 4
- [ ] Measure real-world performance metrics
- [ ] Analyze sim-to-real transfer success

## Prerequisites

- Completed Labs 10-01 and 10-02
- TurtleBot 4 access
- Understanding of RL or control design

## Key Concepts

This lab integrates domain randomization (Lab 10-01) and system identification (Lab 10-02) into a complete sim-to-real pipeline for navigation tasks.

## Implementation Summary

Students implement:
1. Train navigation controller in randomized MuJoCo/Gazebo simulation
2. Validate controller with identified real robot parameters
3. Deploy to TurtleBot 4 via ROS2
4. Measure success rate on real navigation tasks
5. Compare sim vs real performance metrics

## Expected Outcomes

- Working sim-to-real navigation system
- >70% success rate on real hardware
- Analysis of remaining sim-to-real gaps
