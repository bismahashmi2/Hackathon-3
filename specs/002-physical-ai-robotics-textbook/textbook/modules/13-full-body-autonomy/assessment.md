# Assessment Package: Module 13

## Components
- Theory Quiz: 15% (Autonomy architectures, decision making, uncertainty)
- Lab Exercises: 35% (Integration, POMDP, full autonomy)
- Autonomy Project: 35% (Design and deploy autonomous system)
- Ethics Discussion: 15% (Accountability and value alignment)

## Project: Autonomous Mobile Manipulator
Create system that autonomously navigates warehouse, locates target object, grasps it, and delivers to designated location.

**Success criteria:** Complete task 3/3 trials without human intervention.

## Quiz Sample
**Q**: Why is sensor fusion critical for autonomous systems?
**A**: No single sensor provides complete, reliable information. Fusion improves robustness and reduces uncertainty.
