# Ethics in Full-Body Autonomy

## Overview
Fully autonomous robots make decisions without human oversight, raising accountability and control questions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Accountability for Autonomous Decisions
When autonomous robots cause harm, who is responsible?
- Designer of decision system
- Operator who deployed system
- Robot manufacturer
- The "autonomous" system itself (can it bear responsibility?)

### 2. Human Oversight Requirements
Should truly autonomous robots exist?
- Some argue humans must always be in decision loop
- Others note human oversight can be impractical or harmful (reaction time)
- What decisions can we ethically delegate to machines?

### 3. Value Alignment
Autonomous systems pursue objectives. Do those objectives align with human values?
- Efficiency vs safety tradeoffs
- Short-term vs long-term outcomes
- Individual vs collective benefit

## Case Study: Autonomous Military Robots
Military robots with full autonomy in target selection raise extreme ethical concerns:
- Can machines ethically make life-death decisions?
- How do we ensure compliance with laws of war?
- What happens when autonomous systems malfunction?

**Most ethicists argue:** Lethal autonomous weapons require human decision-making.

## Discussion Questions
1. What decisions should never be fully automated?
2. How do we audit autonomous decision-making?
3. Can autonomous systems be held accountable?

## Summary
Full autonomy requires clear accountability, appropriate human oversight, and careful value alignment. Some decisions may be inherently unsuitable for automation.
