# Lab 13-01: Integrated System

## Objectives
- Design complete autonomy stack
- Integrate perception, planning, and control
- Handle real-time execution constraints

## Implementation
Complete pipeline: Camera → object detection → motion planning → trajectory execution. Real-time performance required.

## Rubric: 100 points (Integration: 40/Real-time: 30/Robustness: 30)
