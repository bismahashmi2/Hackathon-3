# Lab 11-01: RL for Robot Control

## Objectives
- Implement PPO algorithm for robot control
- Train policy in MuJoCo simulation
- Analyze learning curves and convergence

## Key Implementation
Students implement Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train a reaching controller for a 2-DOF arm. Includes reward shaping, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Rubric: 100 points (Implementation: 40/Training: 30/Analysis: 30)
