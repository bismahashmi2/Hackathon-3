# Lab 11-03: Policy Optimization

## Objectives
- Implement policy gradient methods
- Fine-tune pre-trained policies
- Transfer policies across tasks

## Key Implementation
Advanced policy optimization with task transfer. Students fine-tune policies from one task to related tasks.

## Rubric: 100 points (Optimization: 40/Transfer: 35/Analysis: 25)
