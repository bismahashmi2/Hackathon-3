# Assessment Package: Module 11

## Components
- Theory Quiz: 15% (RL fundamentals, policy gradients, value functions)
- Lab Exercises: 35% (3 labs on RL, imitation, optimization)
- Learning Project: 35% (Train controller for manipulation task)
- Ethics Discussion: 15% (Explainability and safety in learned control)

## Project: Train Manipulation Controller
Train an RL policy to perform pick-and-place using sparse rewards. Achieve >80% success rate within reasonable training time.

## Sample Quiz Questions
**Q**: What is the primary advantage of PPO over vanilla policy gradient?
**A**: Clipped objective prevents destructively large policy updates

**Q**: Behavioral cloning can fail when:
**A**: Training data doesn't cover test distribution (distributional shift)
