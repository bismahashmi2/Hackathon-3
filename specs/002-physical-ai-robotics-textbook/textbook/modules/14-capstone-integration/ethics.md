# Ethics in Robotics System Design

## Overview
The capstone integrates all course content. This is the opportunity to reflect on ethical considerations throughout the design process.

## Design Ethics Checklist

### 1. Safety by Design
- Have we identified all failure modes?
- Are there redundant safety systems?
- Can the system fail safely?

### 2. Privacy and Data
- What data does the system collect?
- Who has access? How long is it retained?
- Are users informed and consenting?

### 3. Accessibility and Fairness
- Can diverse users interact with the system?
- Does performance vary across user groups?
- Who is excluded by design choices?

### 4. Environmental Impact
- What is the energy cost of operation?
- How are components sourced and disposed of?
- What is the net environmental impact?

### 5. Societal Impact
- Who benefits from this system?
- Who might be harmed?
- What are unintended consequences?

## Capstone Ethics Requirement

Students must include ethics section in capstone documenting:
1. Ethical considerations in design choices
2. Potential negative impacts and mitigations
3. Accessibility and fairness analysis
4. Long-term societal implications

## Summary
Responsible robotics requires ethical consideration at every design stage, not as an afterthought. The capstone is where students demonstrate integrated ethical reasoning.
