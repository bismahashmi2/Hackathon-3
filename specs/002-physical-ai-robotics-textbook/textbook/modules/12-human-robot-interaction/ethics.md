# Ethics in Human-Robot Interaction

## Overview
Robots that interact with humans must respect autonomy, safety, and social norms.

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Autonomy and Consent
- Robots should not manipulate or coerce humans
- Interactions should be opt-in where possible
- Humans must be able to override robot actions

### 2. Safety in Proximity
- Physical safety is paramount in HRI
- Robots must be designed for safe failure modes
- Contact forces must be limited and controlled

### 3. Transparency of Intent
- Robots should signal their intentions clearly
- Unexpected movements create fear and distrust
- Motion legibility is an ethical requirement

## Case Study: Care Robot in Hospital
A care robot assists elderly patients. It can physically guide patients, remind them of medications, and call for help.

**Ethical dimensions:**
- **Autonomy**: Does robot guidance restrict patient freedom?
- **Dignity**: How does robot assistance affect patient dignity?
- **Privacy**: Robot observes and records patient activities
- **Dependence**: Do patients become over-reliant on robot?

**Questions:**
1. When should robots defer to human preferences vs insisting on "optimal" behavior?
2. How much monitoring is acceptable for safety vs privacy?

## Summary
Ethical HRI respects human autonomy, prioritizes safety, and maintains transparency in robot intentions and capabilities.
