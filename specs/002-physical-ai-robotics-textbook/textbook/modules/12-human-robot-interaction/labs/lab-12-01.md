# Lab 12-01: Safety Zones

## Objectives
- Implement safety zone monitoring
- Design collision avoidance controllers
- Test human-robot proximity handling

## Implementation
Students create safety zones around humans (detected via simulated sensors) and implement velocity scaling and emergency stops based on proximity.

## Rubric: 100 points (Detection: 25/Avoidance: 40/Testing: 35)
