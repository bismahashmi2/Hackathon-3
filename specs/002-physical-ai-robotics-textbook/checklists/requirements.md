# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-19
**Feature**: [specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md](/mnt/d/Code/hackathon/constitution/specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes
- All clarification markers resolved via research.md:
  - FR-007: Industry distribution defined (Manufacturing 35%, Healthcare 25%, Research 20%, Disaster 12%, Consumer 8%)
  - FR-008: Three-tier accessibility model specified (Tier 1 simulation-only covers 100% of learning objectives)
