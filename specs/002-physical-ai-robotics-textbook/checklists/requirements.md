# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-19
**Feature**: [specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md](/mnt/d/Code/hackathon/constitution/specs/002-physical-ai-robotics-textbook/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All clarification markers resolved:

  - **FR-007 (Industry Distribution)**:
    Case studies will focus on:
    - Healthcare (assistive robots, rehabilitation, elder care)
    - Manufacturing (assembly, inspection, logistics)
    - Disaster Response (search-and-rescue, hazardous environments)

  - **FR-008 (Lab Accessibility Level)**:
    Labs will follow a hybrid accessibility model:
    - Core labs runnable entirely in simulation environments
    - Optional low-cost physical platforms (e.g., Raspberry Pi,
      microcontrollers, modular or 3D-printed components)
    - No mandatory requirement for expensive humanoid robots
